# ShopPlatform
Theory of programming end of year web application. A shop platform that allows people to buy and sell stuff..

## ideas:
- Something between Steam and Aliexpress.
- Have a web application with accounts with different permissions and rights(Admin, Buyer, Seller, Company buyer/seller, Premium buyer/seller)
- Platform that focuses only on the items sold and the users. Make many features that describe the items and the users
- Search system. Tags.
- Different payment methods.
- User "badges", description and everything that makes a user more unique/trustworthy(milestones for months/years since joining the site, net worth of things bought/sold)
- Events - something happening at a particular(maybe random) time that gives something to the user(badges, privileges or whatever)
- Buyers can use the site free and post and search for offers free, but VIP offers should be paid(except as possible reward from event or something)
- Referal system. When a user Invites a friend that buys/sells from the site he gets a bonus(VIP offers/ badges, coins)
- Coins - can be won by players participating in events, that can be exchanged for something or played with. Something like the aliexpress minigames. A person should be able to buy both VIP offers and coins. coins themselves should be changable for VIP offers, however it should require less money for something using the site coins than real money. This provokes the user to  play the minigames/ spend more time on the site and possibly lose/win coins. Basically the way casinos make money off of the gready nature of people.
